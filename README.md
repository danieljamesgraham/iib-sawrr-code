# IIB Project Code

## SAW Coupling Simulations

Simulate the coupling of SAWs between the input waveguide and the ring resonator.

## Scripts

### Principle of Operation

Generate a plot showing a random noisy input signal and a filtered output signal with only specific frequencies present.

### Q Factor

Estimate the Q factor of the ring resonator.

### Coupling Length

Calculate the coupling length between the input waveguide and the ring resonator.

### IDT Coordinates

Calculate the IDT coordinates for linear-frequency modulation.
